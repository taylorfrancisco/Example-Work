For every year, the better category always has more respondents with matching
political affiliation as the sitting President. Meaning for every year that a 
democrat was President, there are more democrat respondents who view the economy 
as being better. A similar pattern occurs for the worse category, those with 
opposing political affiliations to the sitting President consistently rate 
the economy as being worse. For the same category, it is fairly equal from both 
parties, regardless of the President's affiliation. 

#Question 2

            ymin = -Inf,ymax = Inf,alpha = 0.3)  +
    geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "dodge") +
    #assign colors to each variable, add descriptive label 
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("D" = "lightblue", "R" = "pink", "dem" = "blue2", "rep" = "red3"), 
                      name="D/R= Party of President \n dem/rep = Party of Respondent")  +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0.5)) +
    facet_wrap(year ~ .) +
     labs(x="Personal Economy Evaluation",y="Count") +
        ggtitle("View of Personal Economy by Party Alignment")

There are similar patterns in personal evaluation as in the  national evaluations. 
For the better category, however, there seems to be a less strong pattern of matching 
affiliations between respondent and President. While for most years those who match 
the President's affiliation have more respondents answering "better", but the
differences are a lot more subtle than the national evaluations, save for 2012
going forward. Surprisingly, democrats consistently view their personal economics
as being worse, regardless of the President's affiliation. Again this pattern is
disrupted in 2012 going forward. The biggest difference to national evaluations 
are in the years 2012, 2016, and 2020. In 2012 the views are quite polarized with 
the majority of people either being "better" or "worse". The pattern of matching 
ideologies still is present in this year. In 2016 and 2020 there is a lot more 
central opinions, with the bulk of respondents being in the "same" category.
