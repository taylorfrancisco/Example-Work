The logic being that if a person has a severe bias against a group of people, that will lead to higher cortisol levels whenever they are exposed to somone who is a part of that group, due to an increase in fear or frustration that they associate with that group. Having frequently high cortisol is deleterious to health. I am curious to see if this hypothesized increase in cortisol would produce a causal relationship between a racism indicator and perceived health. If my assumption holds true, my independent variable of perceived level of how hardworking black people are will be predictive of worse overall health."

There may be an omitted variable that is driving both health and perception of black people that is obscuring the direct relationship between racism and health. For example, it is possible that some people are just more generally positive in life and thus have a more optimisitc view of their health and kinder perceptions of people in general. This type of omitted variable is difficult to measure and thus cannot be controlled for. Instead, an instrumental variable could be used to circumvent this variable by using a proxy of such for perception of black people that is not impacted by general optimism.

While the OLS did support my initial hypothesis, it is also possible that my proxy for racism (how individuals view the hard-working nature of black people) could also not be a valid proxy. More exploration should be done finding other potential indicators of racism and also crucially other instrumental variables that are strong are necessary to really answer my question of interest.
